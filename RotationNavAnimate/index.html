                <h1>Book Review</h1>
                <h2>Ultralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career</h2>
                <small>Brief Introduction</small> 
                <p>
                    This book is organized into 9 principles: metalearning, focus, directness, drill, retrieval, feedback, retention, intuition and experimentation. The main idea is to master hard skills quickly without old routines and ways of solving problems. These self-education tools are based on author’s real experience combining other ultralearner’s tips.
                </p>

                <p>The 9 techniques are described with clear explanations and examples, facilitating me to directly use them for learning new skills. Although these tools are seemed like cliche, they are quite useful especially for learning some subjects. For me, I think that the “directness” skill is the most useful for me because as a new programmer, I feel a little bit confused about how to apply coding skills into real product. This technique helps me to focus on the final result that I want to acquire by doing exactly what is required in my final project. No more sideway or redundant preparation would be done so that detouring would not apply, representing that I am practicing the “must have” skills for actual product. In addition, while studying for the final exam, I use the recall method to review the topics that are mentioned in the past exam. Therefore, I study efficiently and gain good mark in this exam. In conclusion, trying new learning methods and finding the most suitable habits to reach goals are two key concepts learned in this book. I will keep using these principles to examine that whether successful learning habits are still useful to counter different challenges.</p>
