# Description
Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern. Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s.
- pattern contains only lower-case English letters.
- s contains only lower-case English letters and spaces ' '.
- s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
- All the words in s are separated by a single space.
