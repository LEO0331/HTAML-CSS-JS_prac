Delete a node in a singly-linked list. Access to the head of the list is not given, instead access to the node to be deleted directly will be given. It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the list. The value of each node in the list is unique.
The node to be deleted is in the list and is not a tail node.
